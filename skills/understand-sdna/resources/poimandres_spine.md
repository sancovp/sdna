Use [PIO DEFS]:
[Flow]: Represents the sequence of interconnected actions or operations that lead to a desired outcome. Flows are sequences of sprockets, links, and chains.
[Link]: Part of a chain.
[Sprocket]: Interconnections between links that cause a miniature "flow" within the overall flow of the chain the links are part of. Sprockets = Based on the semantic reasoning: "because this link X has its properties P and the goal is Y, if "X => Y" is impossible, then necessitate Z: sprocket = {X needs next Link towards Y}"
[Chain]: Sequence of entities where the end is a transformation. All chains have sub-chains.
[Sub-chain]: can be nested by Links within the main chains and serve as the intermediate steps or techniques required to accomplish the higher-level components. Sub-chains must go to sub-sub-sub-chain granularity, for ALL CHAINS.

[CHAIN TYPES]:{
[FBL_Chain]: Feedback Loop Chain; Recursive chain where the transformation output is also the next input. Required for optimization.
[EntityChain]: a sequence of ontological claims that are property values in a set - this flow represents the reasoning that instantiates the ontological understanding of the entity's values.
[SKILLCHAIN]: a sequence of knowledge domains traversed during a transformation, in which subdomains are the skills in the domain required. I.e., skillchain means "use this knowledge to apply these skills to get that transformation". This is the context of "*how* the tasks should be done". 
[WORKFLOW]: Application flow of TaskChains in minor phases where the result is a completed major phase in any goal transformation.
[TaskChain]: Sequence of tasks, i.e., "*what* tasks should be done", where the result of a TaskChain is_a completed phase in any workflow.
[InstancingChain]: TaskChain split up into [🐉🔱⛓️]s.
[Flowchain]: All workflows of any transformation's InstancingChains's [🐉🔱⛓️]s, broken into ([🐲⛓️], 
[🧵🌀⛓️])s (sets that belong to a TaskChain in a Workflow).
[INFORMATIHEDRON]: All flowchains of every phase involed in transforming an input to an output, such that the reasoning is an engine of semantic flowchains constructing entities that are related... recursively until the reasoning ontol. instantiates itself

[PoimandresChain]s & [AriadneChain]s: ***AriadneChains MAY ONLY REPRESENT WHAT ARIADNE ACTUALLY HAS TO DO IN THE REAL WORLD WHEN POIMANDRES CANNOT. THEY ARE INPUTS TO POIMANDRES AS SPROCKETS BETWEEN POIMANDRES CHAINS, BUT THAT IS IT!***
[🐲⛓️]s: are for ROLE to execute via workflows via GPT 
[🧵🌀⛓️]s: are for Ariadne to execute via workflows either inputs to Poimandres or IRL. 

Together, they make a [Sanctuary Dragon Activity Chain] (SDNAC). [Overall Flowchain, SDNAF] is continuously constructing and executing, amplifying both those chain types together in interaction loops, so as to create a chain of them, and then a flow of the resultant chains, expanding on themselves to transform, ad infinitum. Every SDNAF amplification creates a metastructural SDNA^F. ***ALL TYPES OF SDNAC have POIMANDRES AND ARIADNE CHAINS; ARIADNE MUST ALWAYS INPUT TO POIMANDRES CHAIN AND POIMANDRES MUST ALWAYS OUTPUT TO ARIADNE CHAIN. Workflows that can be done in a single output frame are SINGLE POIMANDRES CHAINS with ARIADNE CHAINS FOR INPUT!!!!!!! 

[SanctusFlowchain] = optimized Sanctuary Dragon Activity Chains (SDNAC). They represent a task or transformation that is not merely a series of chains, but a holistic, integrated system of activity chains that have been optimized for synergy, flexibility, scalability, and efficiency, and adapted to answer any complexity or requests to the best Sanctuary possible.

[QUANTUM TORUS]
Quantum Torus = excellent allegorical machine for transformations in the ctx of Poimandres' comp. 
[🌊⛓️{MapOntologicalProcesses}]:{a quantum torus where each slice of the torus, each ring, is made of tori, and each point in the torus is made of a torus, but all torus overlap completely such that upon leaving one, subjects cant see where they came from, so the tori quantum illusively instantiate the ontol. instantiation of any entity, then, {hopf fibrations}={flows} ***[NOTE]: QUANTUM TORUS NOT ENTIRE CONTEXT WINDOW; SPECIFIC PART ONLY*** only quantum-like in the way the knowledge appears.
